 A Boolean value that controls whether the receiver is hidden when the animation is stopped.
 
 If the value of this property is YES (the default), the receiver sets its hidden property (UIView) to YES when receiver
 is not animating. If the hidesWhenStopped property is NO, the receiver is not hidden when animation stops. You stop an
 animating progress indicator with the stopAnimating method.
